        <p class="paragraph-text">
          Andrew McMahon, born September 3, 1982, has been at the center of three wildly successful musical projects. An east coast kid transplanted to Orange County as a teenager, McMahon discovered a gift for the piano and songwriting at a young age. In 1998, he formed a unique piano-punk band called Something Corporate, signing to Drive Thru Records in 2000. The band released two genre expanding full-length albums and toured the world extensively, becoming main stage fixtures on the summer Vans Warped Tour.

        <p class="paragraph-text">
          In 2004, McMahon began to transition from Something Corporate into a new indie pop project called Jack's Mannequin. While he would ultimately release three popular albums under this name, including the wildly successful debut "Everything in Transit", McMahon would first learn that he had been diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 2005 and undergo several courses of treatment, including a stem cell transplant. McMahon achieved full remission and later founded the <a class="text-link" href="http://www.dearjackfoundation.org" target="_blank">Dear Jack Foundation</a> to raise funds for cancer research, register bone marrow donors from all over the world, and coordinate marrow matches for other young adults suffering from the same condition.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-text">
          In 2014, having already experienced the ups and downs of two successful projects, a cancer diagnosis, and full remission by the age of 32, McMahon made the decision to record music and tour as a solo artist under the project name Andrew McMahon in the Wilderness. His first single "Cecilia and the Satellite", named after his newly born daughter, peaked at #96 on the Billboard Hot 100 as well as became a top-ten hit on several genre-specific charts. 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-text">
          McMahon continues to make music as Andrew McMahon in the Wilderness and has since released three more full-length albums and several singles. He resides in California along with his wife and daughter.
